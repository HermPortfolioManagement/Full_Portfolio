This is a growing portfolio of Thomas Joseph Herm Jr, and will likely predominately contain code I wrote for U of L courses, and Linkedin Courses.

I try to take things a step further than course requirements, and promote good reability, organization, security, and documentation when helpful.

# Note on Organization
In order to simulate a work environment that better demonstrates the concept of least privilege, and to aid in creating code-specific workspaces, a fork has been made at https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Full_Portfolio. This has been further forked into separate codebases. The primary fork is attatched to the personal repo, and so there will be little to no difference between the two; the organization used creates a primary fork for organization purposes.

## Forks
* https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Full_Portfolio - full portfolio
* https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Java - Java portfolio
* https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Python - Python portfolio
* https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/C_CPP - C/C++ portfolio


# Recent Changes
Branches were made for each language inside the organization portfolio, and the forks were remade to connect with the branches. This allows each workspace to only have the code it needs.
