This is a growing portfolio of Thomas Joseph Herm Jr, and will likely predominately contain code I wrote for U of L courses, and Linkedin Courses.

I try to take things a step further than course requirements, and promote good reability, organization, security, and documentation when helpful.

# Note on Organization
In order to simulate a work environment that better demonstrates the concept of least privilege, and to aid in creating code-specific workspaces, a fork has been made at https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Full_Portfolio. This has been further forked into separate codebases. The primary fork is attatched to the personal repo, and so there will be little to no difference between the two; the organization used creates a primary fork for organization purposes.

## Forks
https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Full_Portfolio - full portfolio
https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Java - Java portfolio
https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/Python - Python portfolio
https://github.com/HermPortfolioManagement/C_CPP - C/C++ portfolio


# Upcoming Changes
I aim to transition this into a portfolio showing active workspaces; I am still learning git, and so I'll need to learn more about how to filter which changes get pulled when using forks.
